## Setup

1. Clone the project
2. Setup CocoaPods by running `pod install`. This will generate the required project files
3. Open the workspace
4. Set your API key in `Constants.tmdbApiKey`. This is just a temporary place to setup the key, as it could be improved to allow for automation through a CI

## Remarks

The app is very basic. It's just a quick practice & challenge I did in a single afternoon. It displays the discover movies, allows for searching the list of movies, seeing the details & favoriting. I'm no UI designer, so the interface is very basic but functional.

It supports both iPhone & iPad (regular & compact), landscape & portrait, as well as side-by-side multitasking. 

This is not a fully polished project. A lot of improvements could be made but I haven't had the time to get around to all of them. I left TODOs throughout the code where relevant.
